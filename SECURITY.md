## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainers (if you have access to contact information)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature by going to the Security tab of this repository and clicking "Report a vulnerability"
3. **Private Issue**: Create a private issue if your GitHub account has that capability

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress, at least every 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 90 days of initial report

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and determine the release timeline
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on public disclosure timing
5. **Credit**: We'll acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

### Security Best Practices for Users

While using this binary search implementation:

- Always validate input data before passing to the binary search function
- Ensure arrays are properly sorted before using binary search
- Be cautious when using this code in production systems handling sensitive data
- Keep your Java runtime environment up to date

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The main binary search implementation in `src/Main.java`
- Any additional code or documentation in this repository
- Build and deployment configurations

### Security Considerations

This is an educational project implementing a basic algorithm. However, if you're using this code in production:

- Input validation is limited - ensure proper validation in your implementation
- Integer overflow could occur with very large array indices
- No authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented

### Contact

For security-related questions that don't involve reporting vulnerabilities, please:

- Open a regular GitHub issue with the "security" label
- Check our [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) file for general contact information
