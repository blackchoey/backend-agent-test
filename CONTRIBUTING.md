## Getting Started

This is a simple Java application designed for testing and learning purposes. The project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts and serves as a sandbox for experimentation.

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
  - Verify installation: `java -version` and `javac -version`
- **Git** for version control
- **Text editor or IDE** (IntelliJ IDEA is recommended as the project includes IDEA configuration)

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/backend-agent-test.git
cd backend-agent-test
```

### 2. Set Up Remote Upstream

```bash
# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/blackchoey/backend-agent-test.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
```

### 3. Build and Test the Project

```bash
# Compile the Java code
javac src/Main.java

# Run the program
java -cp src Main

# Expected output:
# Hello and welcome!i = 1
# i = 2
# i = 3
# i = 4
# i = 5
```

### 4. IDE Setup (Optional but Recommended)

#### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Select "Open" and choose the project directory
3. The IDE will automatically recognize the module configuration (`test.iml`)
4. You can run the `Main` class directly from the IDE

#### Other IDEs
- **Eclipse**: Import as existing Java project
- **VS Code**: Install Java Extension Pack and open the folder
- **Command Line**: Use any text editor with `javac` and `java` commands

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test your changes locally before committing

### 3. Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:

```bash
git commit -m "type: brief description"

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat: add method for calculating factorial"
git commit -m "fix: correct binary search loop condition"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"
git commit -m "refactor: improve variable naming in main method"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Code Style Guidelines

### Java Coding Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Main`, `BinarySearch`)
   - Methods: `camelCase` (e.g., `binarySearch`, `calculateSum`)
   - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `targetValue`, `arrayLength`)
   - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_VALUE`)

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
   - Maximum line length: 120 characters
   - Always use braces for control structures, even single statements
   - Add blank lines to separate logical sections

3. **Comments and Documentation**
   - Write JavaDoc comments for public methods and classes
   - Use inline comments sparingly, only when necessary
   - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

4. **Example of Good Code Style**

```java
/**
 * Performs binary search on a sorted array.
 * 
 * @param arr the sorted array to search
 * @param target the value to find
 * @return the index of target if found, -1 otherwise
 */
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Since this is a learning project, manual testing is currently the primary method:

1. **Compile and Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Compile
   javac src/Main.java
   
   # Run with different inputs (if applicable)
   java -cp src Main
   ```

2. **Test Different Scenarios**
   - Test with valid inputs
   - Test edge cases
   - Verify expected output matches actual output

### Adding Automated Tests (Future Enhancement)

If you want to add unit tests:
1. Create a `test` directory
2. Add JUnit or similar testing framework
3. Write test cases for new functionality
4. Update this guide with testing instructions

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Prepare Your Branch

```bash
# Update your fork with latest changes
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Rebase your feature branch (optional but recommended)
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase main
```

### 2. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "New pull request"
3. Select your feature branch
4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
   - **Description**: What changes you made and why
   - **Testing**: How you tested the changes
   - **Screenshots**: If applicable (for output changes)

### 4. PR Review Process

- Maintain a respectful and constructive tone
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Make requested changes promptly
- Keep the PR updated with the main branch if needed

## Reporting Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Try the latest version** to see if the issue persists
3. **Gather information** about your environment

### Creating a Good Issue Report

Use the following template:

```markdown
**Bug Description**
A clear description of what the bug is.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Compile with: `javac src/Main.java`
2. Run with: `java -cp src Main`
3. See error

**Expected Behavior**
What you expected to happen.

**Actual Behavior**
What actually happened.

**Environment**
- OS: [e.g., Windows 10, macOS 12, Ubuntu 20.04]
- Java Version: [e.g., OpenJDK 11.0.2]
- IDE: [e.g., IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1]

**Additional Context**
Any other context about the problem.
```

### Issue Labels

Common labels used in this project:
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
