## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
  - Check your Java version: `java -version`
  - Download from [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) if needed

- **IDE (Recommended)**
  - IntelliJ IDEA (project is pre-configured)
  - Eclipse
  - VS Code with Java Extension Pack
  - Or any text editor of your choice

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/backend-agent-test.git
   cd backend-agent-test
   ```

2. **Open in Your IDE**
   - For IntelliJ IDEA: Open the project folder directly
   - For other IDEs: Import as a Java project

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Compile the project
   mkdir -p out
   javac src/Main.java -d out/
   
   # Run the application
   java -cp out/ Main
   ```
   
   Expected output:
   ```
   Hello and welcome!
   i = 1
   i = 2
   i = 3
   i = 4
   i = 5
   ```

## Building and Running

### Command Line

```bash
# Compile
mkdir -p out
javac src/Main.java -d out/

# Run
java -cp out/ Main

# Clean
rm -rf out/
```

### IDE Integration

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Use the green arrow next to the `main` method or `Shift + F10`
- **Eclipse**: Right-click on Main.java â†’ Run As â†’ Java Application
- **VS Code**: Use the "Run Java" button or `F5`

## Code Style and Conventions

### Java Code Style

- Follow standard Java naming conventions:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods and variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Always use braces for control structures, even single-line statements

### Example

```java
public class MyClass {
    private static final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
    
    public void myMethod(String parameterName) {
        if (parameterName != null) {
            System.out.println("Processing: " + parameterName);
        }
    }
}
```
