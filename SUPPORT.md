# Support

Thank you for using our Binary Search Implementation! This document provides information on how to get help and support.

## Getting Help

### Documentation

Before asking for help, please check our documentation:

- **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview, installation, and usage instructions
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute to the project
- **[docs/](docs/)** - Detailed documentation and guides

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Compilation Issues

**Problem**: `javac: command not found`
**Solution**: Install Java Development Kit (JDK). On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

**Problem**: `Main.java:X: error: cannot find symbol`
**Solution**: Ensure you're compiling from the correct directory:
```bash
cd backend-agent-test
javac src/Main.java
```

#### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: `Error: Could not find or load main class Main`
**Solution**: Use the correct classpath when running:
```bash
java -cp src Main 1 2 3 4 5 3
```

**Problem**: `NumberFormatException`
**Solution**: Ensure all command-line arguments are valid integers:
```bash
# Correct
java -cp src Main 1 2 3 4 5 3

# Incorrect (contains non-numeric values)
java -cp src Main a b c d e f
```

#### Algorithm Issues

**Problem**: Binary search returns incorrect results
**Solution**: Ensure your input array is sorted in ascending order:
```bash
# Correct (sorted array)
java -cp src Main 1 2 3 4 5 3

# Incorrect (unsorted array)
java -cp src Main 5 2 1 4 3 3
```
