# Java Hello World Project

A simple Java application that demonstrates basic Java programming concepts. This beginner-friendly project prints a welcome message and displays a counting sequence from 1 to 5.

## Description

This is a basic Java learning project that showcases:
- Basic Java syntax and structure
- Using `System.out.printf()` and `System.out.println()` for output
- Simple for-loop implementation
- Basic project organization

The application outputs:
```
Hello and welcome!i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .idea/                  # IntelliJ IDEA configuration files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ misc.xml           # Project settings (JDK version, etc.)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules.xml        # Module configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                   # Source code directory
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.java         # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test.iml              # IntelliJ IDEA module file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

### Key Files

- **`src/Main.java`** - The main application file containing the `Main` class and `main` method
- **`test.iml`** - IntelliJ IDEA module configuration file
- **`.idea/`** - Directory containing IntelliJ IDEA project settings

## Development Setup

### Using IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)

1. **Open the project**
   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA
   - Click "Open" and select the project directory
   - The IDE will automatically recognize the project configuration

2. **Configure JDK (if needed)**
   - Go to File ‚Üí Project Structure
   - Under "Project Settings" ‚Üí "Project"
   - Set the Project SDK to your installed JDK version

3. **Run/Debug the application**
   - Right-click on `Main.java` in the project explorer
   - Select "Run 'Main.main()'" or "Debug 'Main.main()'"

### Using Command Line

1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend-agent-test
   ```

2. **Compile and run**
   ```bash
   # Compile
   javac src/Main.java
   
   # Run
   java -cp src Main
   ```

3. **Clean compiled files (optional)**
   ```bash
   rm src/*.class
   ```
