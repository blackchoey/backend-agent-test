# Backend Agent Test

A simple Java application for testing and learning purposes.

## Description

This is a basic Java program that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including:
- Console output using `System.out.printf()` and `System.out.println()`
- For loops and iteration
- Basic program structure

The program outputs a welcome message followed by a count from 1 to 5.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command line access
