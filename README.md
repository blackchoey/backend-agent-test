# Backend Agent Test

A simple Java application project for testing and development purposes.

## Description

This is a basic Java project that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including:
- Basic output using `System.out.printf()` and `System.out.println()`
- Loop structures with a simple for loop
- Standard Java application structure with a main method

## Project Structure

```
backend-agent-test/
├── src/
│   └── Main.java          # Main application entry point
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore patterns
├── test.iml              # IntelliJ IDEA module file
└── README.md             # This file
```

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.) or command line tools

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

#### Using Command Line

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend-agent-test
   ```

2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac src/Main.java
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java -cp src Main
   ```

#### Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Navigate to `src/Main.java`
3. Click the green play button in the gutter next to the `main` method
4. Or use the keyboard shortcut to run the code

### Expected Output

When you run the application, you should see:
```
Hello and welcome!
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

## Development

This project uses IntelliJ IDEA as the primary IDE, as evidenced by the `.iml` file and IDE-specific comments in the code. The project structure follows standard Java conventions.

### Code Overview

- **Main.java**: Contains the main application logic with a simple greeting message and a loop that prints numbers 1 through 5.
