# 🚀 Backend Agent Test

A simple Java application that demonstrates basic console output and iteration. This project serves as a foundational template for Java development and testing.

## 📝 Description

This application prints a welcome message followed by a numbered list from 1 to 5. It's designed as a starting point for Java development and can be extended for more complex backend functionalities.

## ✨ Features

- 💬 Simple console-based "Hello World" implementation
- 🔄 Demonstrates basic loop iteration
- 🧹 Clean, minimal code structure
- 💡 IntelliJ IDEA project configuration included

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- 🛠️ A Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended) or text editor
- 💻 Command line access for compilation and execution

## 🔍 Code Overview

The main application consists of a single class `Main` with the following functionality:

- **👋 Welcome Message**: Prints "Hello and welcome!" to the console
- **🔢 Number Iteration**: Uses a for loop to print numbers 1 through 5
- **🖥️ Console Output**: Demonstrates both `System.out.printf()` and `System.out.println()` methods

## 🛠️ Development

### ➕ Adding New Features

To extend this application:

1. Create new classes in the `src/` directory
2. Follow Java naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods)
3. Update this README with new functionality

### 🎨 Code Style

- Use standard Java naming conventions
- Include comments for complex logic
- Keep methods small and focused
- Follow the existing indentation pattern (4 spaces)
