# Backend Agent Test

A simple Java application for testing backend agent functionality.

## Description

This is a basic Java console application that demonstrates a simple "Hello World" program with a loop counter. The project serves as a testing ground for backend agent capabilities and Java development workflows.

## Features

- Simple console output with greeting message
- Loop demonstration with counter display
- Clean Java project structure
- IntelliJ IDEA project configuration included

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended, project files included)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java installed on your system:

```bash
java --version
```

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackchoey/backend-agent-test.git
cd backend-agent-test
```

2. Compile the Java source:
```bash
javac src/Main.java -d out
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
java -cp out Main
```

Expected output:
```
Hello and welcome!i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Choose "Open" and select the project directory
3. The project will be automatically configured based on the included `.idea` files
4. Run the `Main` class directly from the IDE

## Development

### Code Structure

- **Main.java**: Contains the main application logic with a simple greeting and loop demonstration
- The application uses standard Java console output (`System.out.printf` and `System.out.println`)

### Making Changes

1. Edit the `src/Main.java` file to modify the application behavior
2. Recompile using `javac src/Main.java -d out`
3. Test your changes by running `java -cp out Main`
