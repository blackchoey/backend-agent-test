# Backend Agent Test 🤖

A simple Java application for testing backend agent functionality. ☕

## Description 📝

This is a basic Java console application that demonstrates a simple "Hello World" program with a loop counter. The project serves as a testing ground for backend agent capabilities and Java development workflows.

## Features ✨

- 💬 Simple console output with greeting message
- 🔄 Loop demonstration with counter display
- 🏗️ Clean Java project structure
- 💡 IntelliJ IDEA project configuration included

## Requirements 📋

- ☕ Java 17 or higher
- 💻 Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended, project files included)

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅

Ensure you have Java installed on your system:

```bash
java --version
```

### Running the Application ▶️

1. 📥 Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackchoey/backend-agent-test.git
cd backend-agent-test
```

2. 🔨 Compile the Java source:
```bash
javac src/Main.java -d out
```

3. 🏃 Run the application:
```bash
java -cp out Main
```

Expected output:
```
Hello and welcome!i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

### Using IntelliJ IDEA 💡

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Choose "Open" and select the project directory
3. The project will be automatically configured based on the included `.idea` files
4. Run the `Main` class directly from the IDE

## Development 🛠️

### Code Structure 🏗️

- **Main.java**: Contains the main application logic with a simple greeting and loop demonstration
- The application uses standard Java console output (`System.out.printf` and `System.out.println`)

### Making Changes ✏️

1. Edit the `src/Main.java` file to modify the application behavior
2. Recompile using `javac src/Main.java -d out`
3. Test your changes by running `java -cp out Main`
