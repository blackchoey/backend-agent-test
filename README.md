## 🚀 How to Run

### Method 1: Using Command Line

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend-agent-test
   ```

2. Compile the Java source code:
   ```bash
   javac src/Main.java -d out
   ```

3. Run the compiled application:
   ```bash
   java -cp out Main
   ```

### Method 2: Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Navigate to `src/Main.java`
3. Click the green arrow next to the `main` method or press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

## 📊 Expected Output

When you run the application, you should see the following output:

```
Hello and welcome!i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

## Code Overview

The main application consists of:
- A welcome message printed using `System.out.printf()`
- A for loop that iterates from 1 to 5
- Each iteration prints the current value of the loop variable

## 🛠️ Development

This project is configured for IntelliJ IDEA and uses Java 21 language features (though it's compatible with Java 17+). The project structure follows standard Java conventions with source code in the `src/` directory.
