# Backend Agent Test

A simple Java project that demonstrates basic programming concepts including console output and loops.

## Description

This project contains a basic Java application that:
- Prints a welcome message to the console
- Demonstrates a simple for loop by counting from 1 to 5
- Serves as a foundation for learning Java programming concepts

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java compiler (javac)

```
Hello and welcome!i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

## Usage

This project is primarily intended for:
- Learning basic Java syntax
- Understanding console output with `System.out.printf()` and `System.out.println()`
- Practicing with for loops
- Testing development environment setup
