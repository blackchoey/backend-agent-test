# Backend Agent Test

A simple Java application that demonstrates basic programming concepts including console output and loop constructs.

## Description

This project contains a basic Java program that serves as an educational example. The program prints a welcome message and demonstrates a simple counting loop from 1 to 5.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java compiler (javac)

## Project Structure

## How to Compile and Run

### Using Command Line

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/Main.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java -cp out Main
   ```

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Right-click on `Main.java` in the Project panel
3. Select "Run 'Main.main()'" or press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

## Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see the following output:

```
Hello and welcome!i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
```

## What the Program Does

The `Main.java` file contains:

1. **Welcome Message**: Prints "Hello and welcome!" to the console
2. **Counting Loop**: Uses a for loop to count from 1 to 5, printing each number
